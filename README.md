The monsters, a fun, colorful webshop theme.

The Monsters are a visual series based out of Cleveland, Ohio. The colorful creatures come from the imagination of local visual, and street artist, Random. These weird, welcoming, and each totally unique monsters have a name, along with a whimsical story that needed to be told in an interactive way.

The webshop was built with WordPress and WooCommerce, and was custom designed to facilitate automated drop shipping through Printful. The client is able to easily list and automate items in the store to help lower overhead costs by updating items, price, and shipping automatically.
